those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes? 
3. How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year? What about for 
flights leaving from Boston (BOS) specifically? 
4. How many flights were cancelled in 2015? What % of cancellations were due to 
weather? What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?
